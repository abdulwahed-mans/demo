# My Streamlit App

This is a basic Streamlit app for displaying and interacting with CSV files. The app is designed to demonstrate how to set up a Python project with Streamlit and manage CSV file uploads.

## Features

- Display data from a local CSV file (`demo.csv`)
- Option to upload your own CSV file for display
- Responsive design using Streamlit's built-in features

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Virtual environment (recommended)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   demo preview:

   https://abdulwahed-mans-demo-apps-ls3rqb.streamlit.app/

   git clone https://github.com/abdulwahed-mans/demo.git
   cd demo
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the app**:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Open the app**:  
   Streamlit will launch a browser window displaying the app. If it doesn't, open your browser and go to:
   \`\`\`
   http://localhost:8501
   \`\`\`

## File Structure

- \`app.py\`: The main application file that loads and displays CSV data.
- \`demo.csv\`: A sample CSV file included with the project.
- \`.gitignore\`: Specifies which files and folders to exclude from version control.
- \`requirements.txt\`: Contains the list of dependencies to install.
- \`README.md\`: This file, explaining how to set up and run the project.
